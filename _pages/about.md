I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), supervised by [Prof. Tianwei Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianwei/).  
I previously received my M.Phil. in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the supervision of [Prof. Can Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/eeyangc/), and my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Lanzhou University.

My broad research interests lie in statistical genetics and computational genomics, with a focus on developing scalable statistical and machine learning frameworks to uncover the genetic architecture and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits. Specifically, my work includes cell-type-specific eQTL mapping through integrative analysis, cell niche detection from spatial transcriptomics data, and cross-population association mapping. Beyond genetics and genomics, I have worked on AI-based methods for medical image analysis, including diffusion-based data augmentation and multimodal segmentation.

Recently, I have developed open-source computational tools for cell-type-specific eQTL analysis and spatially resolved cell niche detection, which are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/xinyiyu) for anyone interested in exploring and applying them.
